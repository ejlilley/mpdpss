### About ###

MPD Playlist Saver n' Switcher is the only program that saves the state of each of your [MPD](http://mpd.wikia.com/) playlists, so when you load a previously saved playlist, you can start from the song you were listening to!

It also provides an easier and faster way to switch MPD playlists! Your job is just choosing a playlist to load! No need to compile it!

It works in any UNIX-like system, including MAC OS X, Linux, Solaris and BSD, and any other system which can run MPD. Please, have a look at [Requirements and Installation](Requirements_and_Installation.md).
