[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:Mpc mpc (>= 0.19)] is required for the latest package. If you can't by some reason upgrade mpc, and mpdpss hasn't been able to save the states of playlists, try the older mpdpss 1.5.

[http://live.gnome.org/Zenity Zenity (>= 2.14)] is required if you want to use the GTK+ graphical interface. Zenity doesn't require you to install GNOME libraries. Versions older than 2.14 might bring errors that would make mpdpss stop.

[http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/ dmenu] or [http://wmii.suckless.org/ wmii (>= 3.9beta)] is required if you want to switch using menus. dmenu is very small and packaged in some distributions as 'dwm-tools', while wmii provides wimenu and is a full window manager.

If you use a Debian based system, you should prefer the .deb package. See [#Debian_based_systems Debian based systems].

For any other Unix-like system: [#All_systems All systems].

To install MPD, mpc, Zenity (optional), and dmenu (optional), you can use your package manager or type the following in a terminal (never type the '$'):

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install mpd mpc zenity dwm-tools
}}}
or
{{{
$ su -c 'apt-get install mpd mpc zenity dwm-tools'
}}}

Download the latest .deb package [http://code.google.com/p/mpdpss/downloads/list available here]. Depending on your system, you can just double click on it. Or you can install it in a terminal (version is represented by 'x.x'):

{{{
$ sudo dpkg -i mpdpss_x.x_all.deb
}}}
or
{{{
$ su -c 'dpkg -i mpdpss_x.x_all.deb'
}}}

Now you can go ahead and check how to use the [Using_the_text_interface text interface], [Using_the_graphical_interface the graphical interface] or [Using_the_menu the menu]!

MPD, mpc, Zenity (optional), and dmenu (optional) should be available at your distribution repositories for simple installation. After making sure you have them installed, download the latest .tar.gz package available at [http://code.google.com/p/mpdpss/downloads/list Featured Downloads]. Extract it using your favorite file manager or issuing the command (version is represented by 'x.x', never type the '$'):

{{{
$ tar xvf mpdpss-x.x.tar.gz
}}}

Then go to the directory you extracted:

{{{
$ cd mpdpss-x.x
}}}

And run .install *AS ROOT*:

{{{
$ sudo ./install
}}}
or
{{{
$ su -c './install'
}}}

mpdpss is supposed to work in Linux, Unix, Solaris, Mac, BSD... If it doesn't, we could work together to fix that: open an [http://code.google.com/p/mpdpss/issues/list issue]!
