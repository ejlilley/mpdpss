Thou it doesn't provide all the functionality available in the other commands, using dmenu or wimenu is fairly the fastest way to switch playlists.

To use dmenu
{{{
$ mpdpss -d
}}}
To parse the options case insensitive (the default for mpdpss) and bottom to dmenu:
{{{
$ mpdpss -dm "-i -b"
}}}

To use wimenu
{{{
$ mpdpss -w
}}}
To parse a prompt with the word 'Choose' to wimenu:
{{{
$ mpdpss -wi "-p Choose"
}}}

wimenu is still in beta stage, so I couldn't make the option '-i' the default for mpdpss.

Please, see [Using_the_text_interface Using the text interface] for all available commands for mpdpss. See also 'man dmenu' and 'man wimenu'.
