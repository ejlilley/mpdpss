[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:Mpc mpc (>= 0.19)] is required for the latest package. If you can't by some reason upgrade mpc, and mpdpss hasn't been able to save the states of playlists, try the older mpdpss 1.5.

[http://live.gnome.org/Zenity Zenity] is required if you want to use the GTK+ graphical interface. Zenity doesn't require you to install GNOME libraries.

If you use a Debian based system, like Ubuntu, MEPIS, antiX, or Linux Mint, you should prefer the .deb package. Go here: [#Debian_based_systems Debian based systems].

Any other Unix-like system: [#All_systems All systems].
