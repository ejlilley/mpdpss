First make sure you have read [Requirements_and_Installation Requirements and Installation].

For the GTK+ graphical interface you need to run mpdpss as "mpdpss -g" or edit $HOME/.mpdpss.conf (which will be created the first time you run it) and set the option "graphical" to "true". [http://live.gnome.org/Zenity Zenity] is required.

MPD Playlist Saver n' Switcher is actually very easy to use. The first time you run it, it will request for a name to the current playlist.

It will save the playlist and you'll be presented with a list of available MPD playlists. Choose the playlist you want to be loaded.

The next time you run it, you won't be asked for a name again, but you will go directly to choose a list, as in screenshot 2! You loaded the playlist "international". The next time, your current playlist will be automatically saved as "international".

*I recommend you then to always switch playlists with mpdpss*. If you, for example, cleared the current playlist and loaded "90s" using your MPD client, mpdpss will try to save it as "international", as it remembers what it did before.

If you want to save that as "90s" instead, you could use the '-p' flag together the '-g'

{{{
$ mpdpss -gp
}}}

Then you'll be prompted for a name to the current playlist, just like in the first time you have run it.

There are many ways to make mpdpss behave more the way you want:

You can have a look at the available commands [Using_the_text_interface here], or by running "mpdpss -gh" or "man mpdpss" (which is more complete).

Most commands have their equivalent configuration, which is provided in the file $HOME/.mpdpss.conf
