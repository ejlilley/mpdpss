==News!==

Version 1.6 has been just released. It contains important bug fixes, adds more options and was revised for portability. It also fixes an important bug reported recently, which would cause mpdpss not to remember the states. So if you have downloaded version 1.5, IT MAY NOT WORK with recent versions of mpc! Please, download mpdpss version 1.6 instead, unless you can't upgrade mpc!

Check the wiki pages "[Requirements]" and "[Unpacking]" first, and then [Using_the_graphical_interface Using the graphical interface]" or [Using_the_text_interface Using the text interface]"!


==Testers needed!==

MPD Playlist Saver n' Switcher will remember the last played song for each of your MPD playlists, so when you load a previously saved playlist, you can start from the song you were listening to.

It also provides an easier and faster way to switch MPD playlists!
